# ‚ôªÔ∏è Green Kitchen System Website: Sustainable Waste-to-Energy Platform

## üåü Project Overview

| **Status** | **Technologies** | **Target Environment** | **Deployment** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Phase 1: MVP** | **Django**, PostgreSQL, M-Pesa | Web & Mobile (via API) | Cloud-Native (AWS/Azure/GCP) |

The **Green Kitchen System Website** is a cutting-edge digital platform designed to **streamline waste management** and provide **clean cooking energy solutions**. It digitizes the entire waste-to-biogas value chain, from incentivized waste collection to the distribution of metered gas cylinders and community open kitchens.

This system is built to promote **sustainability**, create a **circular economy**, and deliver affordable, accessible energy, making it a critical tool for modern waste and energy management.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Objectives (SEO Focus)

* **Sustainable Waste Management:** Incentivizes and tracks the collection of agricultural, household, and animal waste.
* **Biogas Production Tracking:** Monitors waste input, biodigester efficiency, and clean energy (biogas) output.
* **Clean Cooking Energy Solutions:** Provides affordable, accessible cooking energy through metered gas cylinders.
* **Financial Transparency:** Manages transparent waste payments, accrual balances, and gas redemption.
* **Django Backend Architecture:** Ensures a secure, scalable, and robust foundation for the system.

## üë§ User Roles & System Flow

The system supports a diverse set of users, ensuring accountability and efficient process flow across the entire value chain.

### üë• User Roles

1.  **Admin:** System oversight, compliance validation, and comprehensive report generation.
2.  **Waste Collector:** Manages collection points, records waste data, and issues transparent invoices/payments.
3.  **Community Kitchen Manager:** Operates the biodigester, manages gas compression, and oversees open kitchens.
4.  **Distributor:** Supplies gas cylinders and burners, manages sales records, and handles logistics.
5.  **Customer:** Supplies waste, buys metered gas, redeems accruals, and utilizes community open kitchens.

### üîÑ Core Process Flows

#### 1. Waste Collection & Payment
Customers deliver waste ($\text{Agricultural, Household, Animal}$) to **Waste Collectors**. The waste is weighed, and the customer opts for immediate cash payment or accrual of the balance, which can later be redeemed for gas.

#### 2. Internal Biogas Processing
Collected waste is fed into the **Biodigester**. The Django system tracks **waste input volumes**, **biogas output**, and **cylinder stock levels**. By-products (like organic fertilizer) are also tracked for distribution.

#### 3. Sales, Distribution & Redemption
**Distributors** supply metered gas cylinders and burners. Customers pay for gas usage via **M-Pesa Paybill**. Crucially, customers can **redeem their accrued waste balances** to offset gas costs, closing the loop on the circular economy model.

## üìà Reporting & Analytics (Data-Driven Decisions)

The Django backend provides critical reporting to monitor the system's efficiency and impact, ensuring a high level of **transparency** and **compliance**.

* **Waste Trends:** Volume, type, and zone-based analysis.
* **Biodigester Efficiency:** Input-to-output conversion rates.
* **Sales & Revenue Dashboards:** Real-time financial monitoring.
* **User Leaderboards:** Encouraging competition among collection zones.
* **Compliance Status:** Ensuring adherence to safety and operational standards.
